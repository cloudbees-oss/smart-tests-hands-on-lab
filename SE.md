# (CloudBees internal) Workshop guide for SE

> [!TIP]
> Until the successful workshop kata is established, the target audience of this document is assumed to be
> sufficiently familiar with Smart Tests. This document is not yet meant for CloudBees SEs at large yet.

## 1 week prior: Your prep
* Before the actual workshop, go to [customer success storefront](https://cloudbees.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LCHCTS/pages/4448921585/Storefront+Launchable+Customer+Success), create a new workspace, then
  use the workspace flag app to (1) enable PTS, and (2) set the state to "HANDS_ON_LAB_V2"
* Invite the workshop participants to the workspace by creating an invitation link and send it to them
* Hand the URL of this workspace to the participants
* Fork GitHub launchableinc/hands-on-lab to [the cloudbees-days org](https://github.com/cloudbees-days)
  with a unique name, e.g. `hol-20251225`
* Add the workshop participants as collaborators to the forked repository.
* Create a PR from the main branch of the forked repository to `launchableinc/hands-on-lab` main branch.
  (You'll have to create some dummy commit to create a PR.)
* In the description of the PR, add the link to edit page of `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` so that the participants
  can easily edit the workflow file without getting lost in the GitHub UI. This link should look like this:
  `https://github.com/cloudbees-days/hol-20251225/edit/main/.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml`

## Actions from participants
* Provide GitHub user ID and email address
* Follow the invitation link to sign up and obtain access to the workspace
* Have them follow [Lab 0](HANDSON0.md) to ensure they have the prerequisites ready
